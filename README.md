# Phyton - A StarCraft II bot api client library for Python 3

Phyton is an easy-to-use library for wrting AI Bots for StarCraft II in Python 3. The ultimate goal is simplicity and ease of use, while still preserving all funcionality. A really simple worker rush bot should be no more than twenty lines of code, not two hundred.

This library covers only the scripted (raw) interface.
